Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design an interactive Excel Sales Performance Dashboard. This dashboard will allow stakeholders to:

Identify top and bottom sales executives based on performance.

Track regional sales distribution and comparisons.

Monitor target achievement percentage for each executive.

Analyze deviation from targets for improvement planning.

Use interactive controls (slicers and checkboxes) for dynamic analysis.

This dashboard provides actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in sales management.
