# Sales-Performance-Dashboard

## üìå Project Objective 


The goal of this project is to design an interactive Excel Sales Performance Dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

  - Identify top and bottom sales executives based on performance

  - Track regional sales distribution and comparisons

  - Monitor target achievement % for each executive

  - Analyze deviation from targets for improvement planning

  - Use interactive controls (slicers and checkboxes) for dynamic analysis

This dashboard provides actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in sales management.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement


Sales data in raw format often lacks clarity and is time-consuming to interpret.

Managers face challenges in:

  - Identifying consistent top performers

  - Detecting underperforming executives

  - Understanding regional performance trends

  - Monitoring KPIs effectively



This project addresses these issues by developing a dynamic Excel dashboard that simplifies analysis.
