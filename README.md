# Sales-Performance-Dashboard

## üìå Project Objective 


The goal of this project is to design an interactive Excel Sales Performance Dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

  - Identify top and bottom sales executives based on performance

  - Track regional sales distribution and comparisons

  - Monitor target achievement % for each executive

  - Analyze deviation from targets for improvement planning

  - Use interactive controls (slicers and checkboxes) for dynamic analysis

This dashboard provides actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in sales management.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement


Sales data in raw format often lacks clarity and is time-consuming to interpret.

Managers face challenges in:

  - Identifying consistent top performers

  - Detecting underperforming executives

  - Understanding regional performance trends

  - Monitoring KPIs effectively



This project addresses these issues by developing a dynamic Excel dashboard that simplifies analysis.


## üîÑ Process Followed
  1. **Data Preparation** ‚Äì Structured raw sales data (employee code, region, daily sales, and targets).

  2. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Removed inconsistencies, formatted data for reporting.

  3. **Pivot Table Modeling** ‚Äì Created pivot tables to calculate KPIs (total sales, target hit %, away from target %).

  4. **Visualization** ‚Äì Built charts (bar, pie, line) for comparative insights.

  5. **Interactivity** ‚Äì Added slicers and checkboxes with VBA macros to toggle multiple dashboards.

  6. **Dashboard Design** ‚Äì Combined pivot tables and charts into a clean, user-friendly layout.
